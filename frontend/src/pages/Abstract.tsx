        The cement industry plays a crucial role in the construction sector,
        providing the primary building material for infrastructure and buildings
        worldwide. This industry is very important in the field of construction
        and building businesses. Ensuring consistent and high-quality cement is
        essential for construction projects to meet safety and durability
        standards. This machine learning model abstract outlines a novel
        approach for establishing a Cement Quality Prediction system, leveraging
        artificial intelligence and data analytics to enhance cement production
        processes. In this project we also focuses on the fraud detection
        approaches of cement production and dealership businesses.
